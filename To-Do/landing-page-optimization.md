# 528Prep Landing Page Optimization

This document outlines the optimization plan for the 528Prep landing page, focusing on code structure, performance, accessibility, and user experience improvements.

## Current Issues

- **Code Duplication**: Navigation and footer elements are duplicated across pages
- **Component Structure**: UI elements like buttons, cards, and sections are not componentized
- **Performance Concerns**: Images are not optimized and code splitting is not implemented
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Proper semantic elements and ARIA attributes are missing in some areas
- **Hardcoded Data**: Content is hardcoded directly in components rather than in separate data files

## Optimization Roadmap

### Phase 1: Code Structure & Organization (Week 1)

#### High Priority
- [ ] Create shared `Navbar` component
- [ ] Create shared `Footer` component
- [ ] Implement Layout pattern with these components
- [ ] Extract core UI components:
  - [ ] `CTAButton` for call-to-action buttons
  - [ ] `FeatureCard` for feature descriptions
  - [ ] `TestimonialCard` for user testimonials
  - [ ] `Section` for standardized section layouts
- [ ] Move hardcoded data to separate files:
  - [ ] `pricingPlans.js`
  - [ ] `features.js`
  - [ ] `testimonials.js`

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement folder structure best practices:
  ```
  /components
    /ui
    /layout
    /sections
  /hooks
  /data
  /utils
  ```
- [ ] Create API layer/services for future data fetching

### Phase 2: UI Components & Design System (Week 2)

#### High Priority
- [ ] Implement a design system with:
  - [ ] Typography components (`Heading`, `Paragraph`, etc.)
  - [ ] Spacing constants
  - [ ] Color palette variables
  - [ ] Button variants
- [ ] Extract common style patterns into utility classes
- [ ] Convert to CSS variables for colors, spacing, and typography

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Create component variants (button styles, card types)
- [ ] Standardize responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Add dark mode support (optional)

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization (Week 3)

#### High Priority
- [ ] Optimize images:
  - [ ] Implement Next.js Image component
  - [ ] Optimize formats (WebP, AVIF)
  - [ ] Proper sizing and responsive images
- [ ] Add lazy loading for off-screen content
- [ ] Implement code splitting with dynamic imports

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Optimize React rendering:
  - [ ] Analyze component re-renders
  - [ ] Use `React.memo` for pure components
  - [ ] Implement `useMemo` and `useCallback` where appropriate
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton screens
- [ ] Analyze and optimize bundle size

### Phase 4: Accessibility Improvements (Week 4)

#### High Priority
- [ ] Ensure proper semantic HTML throughout
- [ ] Add appropriate ARIA attributes
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- [ ] Fix any color contrast issues

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement focus indicators
- [ ] Add skip links
- [ ] Test with screen readers and fix issues

### Phase 5: User Experience & SEO (Week 5)

#### High Priority
- [ ] Improve form handling with proper validation
- [ ] Ensure responsive design consistency
- [ ] Add proper meta tags and semantic structure for SEO
- [ ] Implement proper heading hierarchy

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add scroll animations for engagement
- [ ] Improve navigation experience
- [ ] Add structured data for rich search results

## Implementation Notes

### Component Structure Example

```jsx
// components/ui/CTAButton.jsx
export function CTAButton({ children, variant = 'primary', ...props }) {
  return (
    <button 
      className={`cta-button ${variant}`} 
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

// Usage
<CTAButton variant="secondary" onClick={handleClick}>
  Start Free Trial
</CTAButton>
```

### Data File Example

```js
// data/pricingPlans.js
export const plans = [
  {
    id: 'free',
    name: "Always Free",
    price: "$0",
    description: "Get started with basic access",
    features: [
      "Full Viewable Access (Premium Features Blurred)",
      "3 Practice Passages",
      "Basic Analytics Dashboard"
    ],
    cta: "Sign Up Free",
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 'basic',
    name: "Basic",
    price: "$99",
    period: "for 3 months",
    description: "Essential CARS preparation",
    features: [
      "250+ Practice Passages",
      "75+ SkillDrills",
      "Performance Analytics",
      "Personalized Study Schedule"
    ],
    cta: "Get Started",
    popular: true
  },
  // Additional plans...
];
```

## Testing & Verification

After each phase, conduct the following checks:

- **Visual Testing**: Ensure the UI appears as expected across devices
- **Functionality Testing**: Verify all interactive elements work as intended
- **Performance Testing**: Use Lighthouse to measure improvements
- **Accessibility Testing**: Use axe or similar tools to check compliance
